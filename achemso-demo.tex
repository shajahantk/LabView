%This study is related to the instrumentation part of the experiments in Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction. 
We report simultaneous recording and delivering electrical stimuli
during the image acquisition of the experiments in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction. The excitation wave formation,
pinning, and unpinning in the BZ reaction is an important topic in the
field of nonlinear dynamics because of its similarity and scope of

reaction use low-voltage DC and AC electric fields. We explored
virtual instrumentation using LabVIEW and developed programs for both
DC and Polarised electric fields. Our programs simultaneously generate
the required voltage signals, capture and save the images for further

\section{Introduction}
The Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction is a chemical reaction that
exhibits oscillating behavior and complex spatial patterns such as
target, spiral, and scroll waves. These types of waves can be found in
various systems, such as the aggregation of Dictyostelium discoideum
amoeba \cite{tan2020topological}, the chicken retina
\cite{yu2012reentrant}, the human brain \cite{rostami2018defects}, the
heart tissue \cite{lebert2023reconstruction}, and the reaction of CO
on platinum surfaces \cite{bhattacharya2019controlling}.  Collectively
referred to as excitable media, these systems have a similar
reaction to an exciting stimulus when it exceeds a certain threshold,
and then they do not respond to any additional stimulus for a specific
duration of time. The BZ reaction has been studied extensively in chemical kinetics and
nonlinear dynamics. The BZ reaction has been found to have several
interesting applications in biological systems, chemical computing
\cite{steinbock1996chemical}\cite{gruenert2013multi}, and
self-propelled motion
\cite{kumar2021fast}\cite{suematsu2018evolution}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
However, imaging the BZ reaction is challenging due to several
factors. The BZ reaction is a non-equilibrium process, and its
dynamics change with time. As a result, imaging the reaction requires
techniques to capture fast changes and non-stationary behavior. Hence
we trigger the camera with counter-output pulses, and the frequency of
the counter signal becomes the frame rate of the camera. The patterns
produced by the BZ reaction are difficult to detect because the
reaction occurs in a semi-transparent solution. We solved this problem
by illuminating a diffused white LED light source below the reaction
medium. Patterns observed in the BZ reaction are blue, so the
camera is mounted with a blue dichroic filter to enhance the
imaging. The patterns produced by the BZ reaction can be small and
require high spatial-resolution imaging techniques to
observe. Achieving sufficient resolution can be difficult, mainly if
the patterns are small or occur in a three-dimensional space. We use a
CCD camera with a maximum resolution of 640x480, and a user can choose
the resolution according to their requirement.  The BZ reaction is
sensitive to changes in temperature, and imaging the reaction requires
precise temperature control to ensure consistent behavior. Hence,
experiments were performed in an AC room with an ambient temperature.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Spiral or scroll waves can be anchored to inhomogeneities in the
medium and become more stabilized patterns. These pinned patterns play
a crucial role in the development of dynamic disorders, including
abnormal heart rhythms \cite{bruser2012automatic}
\cite{kundu2021amplitude} and epilepsy \cite{punacha2020theory}. The
BZ reaction can also be influenced by the application of an electric
field. When a low-voltage electric field is applied to the BZ
reaction, it can change the reaction rate and move the patterns that
are formed. This is because the electric field can alter the movement
of ions and electrons in the solution, affecting the kinetics of the
chemical reactions. Hence, applying a low-voltage electric field can
unpin the pinned waves from the inhomogeneities. Few experiments
reported the unpinning of the pinned waves using electric field
\cite{steinbock1992electric}\cite{ji2013experimental}\cite{jimenez2013electric}\cite{sutthiopad2014unpinning}\cite{porjai2016electrically},
and in those studies, the applied field is directly controlled using
constant current sources and programmable power supplies. The
experimental system requires multiple devices to function together.
Virtual instrumentation can effectively control such tasks. Virtual
instrumentation refers to the use of software and computer technology
to create and control virtual versions of physical instruments. These
virtual instruments can be used for various purposes, such as
scientific research, engineering design, and industrial automation.
Virtual instrumentation is a growing field and is increasingly used in
various industries, including telecommunications, aerospace, and
manufacturing.

LabVIEW (Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench) is a
graphical programming platform widely used for virtual
instrumentation. It allows users to create virtual instruments, also
known as virtual measurement systems, using a drag-and-drop interface
and a vast library of pre-built functions and tools. LabVIEW enables
users to acquire, analyze, and present data in a user-friendly and
customizable way. It also allows the integration of various hardware
devices and instruments, such as oscilloscopes, data acquisition
systems, and control systems, into a single system. A LabVIEW program
consists of a front panel and a block diagram. The front panel and
block diagram work together to create a complete program. The front
panel is the user interface of the LabVIEW program and serves as the
control center for the user. It consists of graphical objects such as
buttons, dials, sliders, and graphs that the user interacts with to
control the program and view the results. The block diagram is the
programming logic of the LabVIEW program and contains graphical
representations of the functions and operations performed by the
program. The block diagram consists of blocks, which are connected to
each other with wires that represent the flow of data. Each block
represents a specific operation, such as mathematical calculations,
data acquisition, or signal processing.

We developed a LabVIEW based virtual interface that can generate voltage signals and
capture the images of the patterns at the same time by using LabVIEW software. We use a multi-functional data acquisition device (NI USB DAQ 6343) to create voltage signals and to trigger a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) camera simultaneously. With our virtual interface, a user can select
the camera, trigger parameters, amplitude, and frequency of the
voltage signals with some mouse clicks. In the BZ experiments, we need
to observe the spiral waves without an electric field and with an
electric field. So, we developed two scripts to capture the images
before and after the field generation. Later, we combined those two
scrips and made them run sequentially. We are able to make DC and
polarised fields with two different codes.  There are other reported
works that use image acquisition and electric field
application. \cite{oddy2004method} Oddy et al. and colleagues have
created a technique based on LabVIEW for measuring the electrophoretic
mobility of fluorescently labeled particles that are submicrometer in
size, as well as the electroosmotic mobility of a microchannel. They
have established explicit expressions for the unknown electrophoretic
and electroosmotic mobilities using particle displacements caused by
applied direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) electric
fields. They capture images of the particle displacements using an
epifluorescent microscope and a CCD camera.  The standard technique to
terminate ventricular fibrillation (VF) is the high voltage direct
current (DC) shock, but it has the potential to cause significant pain
and tissue damage. The specific effect of the DC electric field on
depolarizing the heart during VF remains
uncertain. \cite{musunuri2009ventricular} Musunuri et al. postulated
and found that combining pacing with a low-energy DC field (pacing+DC)
could stop VF by altering the ventricular propagation pattern. They
conducted experiments on six Langendorff-perfusion isolated rabbit
hearts with the ablated sinoatrial (SA) node. The DC field was
administered to the left ventricle (cathode) and right ventricle
(anode). They developed a timed protocol utilizing LabVIEW programming
that delivers pacing, DC, and pacing+DC stimuli in two-second
intervals.  The precise and dynamic measurement of pupil size is
extremely valuable in researching various neuronal functions and
dysfunctions. Despite significant progress in image processing
techniques for determining pupil parameters, there has been relatively
little exploration of practical hardware concerns related to creating
image acquisition systems for pupil analysis. In their work, JKS De
Souza et al. \cite{ji2013experimental} and colleagues in 2013
presented and confirmed the key features of such a system, which is
based on a compact, commercially available, and inexpensive FireWire
digital camera. They successfully implemented two modes of video
recording, namely a continuous mode and an event-triggered mode. The
entire system's interoperability is ensured through a collection of
modular software components hosted on a personal computer and coded in
Labview.  Reddy, B et al. \cite{reddy2015development} has developed a
data acquisition unit for a Compact Airglow photometer (CAP) for
terrestrial and planetary emissions using LabVIEW Software. The data
acquisition unit interfaces a CCD camera with any personal computer.
Hence, our work has wide applications for low-energy electric field
experiments as well as image acquisition.
\section{Methods and Instrumentation}
\subsection{Experimental methods}
To monitor the motions of chemical waves, the experimental system is
illuminated with a diffused white light (Flat LED source) from below,
and the transmitted light is detected with a CCD camera
(mvBLUECOUGAR-X120bc). A tripod (Vanguard Espod CX 203AGH) is used as
a camera stand. The camera is mounted with a blue dichroic filter
(BP470-27) to increase the contrast between the pattern and the
unexcited medium.  LabVIEW software controls the image acquisition and
voltage signals for unpinning. Figure \ref{fig:ex1} shows a schematic
diagram of the experimental setup for polarised field application.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{experiment_setup_01.png}
    \caption{The experimental setup for the polarised filed
      application. Voltage signals from DAQ 6343 are amplified and
      applied to the chemical solution through the cross-arrangement
      of four copper electrodes. }
    \label{fig:ex1}
\end{figure}
To generate voltage signals, we use NI DAQ 6343, also controlled by
LabVIEW software.  We use two copper electrodes for the DC field and a
cross arrangement of four copper electrodes for polarised field
applications. The DAQ can supply a maximum of 20 mA current at the
output. But, the current passing through the solution is more than 20
mA. So, we use electronic circuits designed for current
amplification. An external power supply (LQ 6324T) is used as the
power source for the electronic circuit. The DAQ can generate a signal
with a maximum of $\pm$ 10 V amplitude. Hence the generated signals
should be amplified with appropriate gain. Hence, a non-inverting
amplifier amplifies the output from the DAQ. We require a voltage and
current amplifier circuit for the DC field and the polarised field,
two such circuits with slight modifications.

\section{Results and discussion}
We developed two LabVIEW programs to generate both DC and AC
fields. These programs were used to investigate the mechanism of
spiral wave unpinning in the BZ reaction with both DC and polarized
fields.  Our virtual platform is designed to be
intuitive and easy to use, allowing users to adjust the required
parameters, generate voltage signals, monitor wave dynamics, and save
images to a computer for future analysis, all at the same time.
The front panel of the LabVIEW program is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:ex3}.
The part 1 triggers camera and capture images at the desired frame rate.
In our experiment, frame rate is set as 2 fps. 
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth,height=0.6\linewidth]{Dc_frntpnl - Copy.png}
    \caption{The front panel of the LabVIEW program for image capture
      and DC voltage generation. Part I of the front panel is for
      image acquisition before the DC voltage generation and part II
      is for image acquisition after the DC voltage generation}
    \label{fig:ex3}
\end{figure}

\todo[inline]{Write how camera is triggered} There are four counter-output channels in DAQ 6343. We use the channel "counter 0" to trigger the camera with a duty cycle =0.5.

The corresponding block diagram is shown in \ref{fig:ex4}. 
The 'IMAQdx open camera' opens the camera. We use the
‘IMAQdx property node’ to select trigger parameters displayed on the
front panel. Using ‘DAQmx create channel (CO
Pulse-generation-Frequency) VI,’ we can choose the Counter channel,
frequency, and duty cycle of the trigger. The ‘DAQmx Start Task VI’
starts the signal generation task.  The ‘DAQmx is task done VI’ on the
while loop checks whether the signal generation task is completed or
not in each iteration. The ‘DAQmx configure Grab VI’ configures and
starts the grab acquisition. The ‘IMAQdx Grab VI’ captures the current
image and then passes the images to ‘IMAQ Cast image VI’ to convert
these RGB frames to grayscale since this reduces the data size. Each
image from IMAQ Caste Image VI needs to be written and stored in a
folder inside the computer to collect raw image data. The ‘IMAQ write
file2 VI’ writes the image to a file in the selected format
(png/jpg/bmp/tiff etc.). The iteration terminal of the while loop
gives the sequential names for images. Each iteration number is
converted to a string and concatenated with the file extension and
folder path where we need to store images. The ‘String to Path
function’ converts these concatenated strings to a path and is
connected to the “file path” terminal of the 'IMAQ Write file 2
VI'. This connection commands the 'IMAQ Write file 2 VI' to store the
images in the mentioned folder with the specified file extension. The
‘While loop’ helps to run the code continuously.


\subsubsection{DC Voltage Signal generation}
\subsubsection{Electronic Circuit for voltage and current amplification}
The NI USB DAQ 6343 generates a DC voltage with user-defined
amplitude ($\leq$15V). The output from the non-inverting amplifier is fed to an
NPN power transistor (2N6487) capable of handling enough current
inside the solution. The output from the power transistor is applied
to the chemical solution. We can attain a maximum of + 15 V at the
output using these electronic setups. The electric field, E, can be
varied by using the relation: E= Applied Voltage/distance between
electrodes

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pulse circuit - Copy.jpg}
    \caption{Shows the voltage and current amplifier circuit for DC
      voltage application in the BZ reaction}
    \label{fig:ex2}
\end{figure}


The image acquisition is controlled using a counter-output trigger
from DAQ 6343. There are four counter-output channels in DAQ 6343. We
use channel ‘counter 0’ to trigger the camera. The front panel is
divided into Part I and Part II. Part I is programmed to capture the
images with no applied voltage. The “cam1” displays the configured
camera, and the counter option displays the selected counter output
channel. The program captures the images when the trigger mode is ON,
and the trigger activates when the counter signal is at its rising
edge/falling edge. The trigger frequency decides the frame rate of the
camera.

The duty cycle on the front panel displays the duty cycle of the
counter trigger. The front panel also displays the captured images,
the number of images captured per second, and the number of images
processed per second. Part I will stop and part two of the program
starts as soon as we press a Boolean switch displayed on the front
panel. Part II is programmed to capture the images and generate a DC
voltage signal. We use the channel ‘analog output 0 (AO 0)’ of the DAQ
to generate the voltage. The amplitude of the voltage signal can be
varied using the numeric control button. The waveform chart shows the
generated DC voltage at the output.
\subsubsection{Block diagram}
Figure \ref{fig:ex4} and Figure \ref{fig:ex5} show the block diagram
for image acquisition and DC voltage generation. The block diagram is
divided into Block I and Block II. Block I corresponds to part I, and
block II corresponds to part II of the front panel. Each block is
included in a sequence structure that helps execute the blocks sequentially.
 
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.3\linewidth,angle=90 ]{Block_1.png}
    \caption{Block diagram of the Image acquisition by triggering the
      camera. Block I captures and saves the images before the DC
      voltage generation.}
    \label{fig:ex4}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.3\linewidth,angle=90]{Block_2.png}
    \caption{Block diagram of the image acquisition and DC voltage
      generation. Block II captures and saves the images after DC
      voltage generation.}
    \label{fig:ex5}
\end{figure}
Block II executes as soon as we press the Boolean switch on the front
panel. When the ‘switch’ is ON, the case selector terminal of both
‘case structures’ on the block diagram changes to TRUE and
corresponding codes execute simultaneously. Code in ‘case structure I’
is for signal generation, and code in case structure II is for image
acquisition. "DAQ Assistant Express VI' on the ‘case structure I’
generate a DC Voltage at the Analog output 0 (AO 0). Image acquisition
code on 'case structure II' is the same as in block I, but images will
be stored in a different folder, and it will stop in the presence of
an error or manually pressing a Boolean stop button.
\subsection{AC Voltage signal Generation}
\subsubsection{Electronic circuit for voltage and current amplification}
To apply a polarised field, we generate two identical AC signals with
a specific phase difference. An electronic circuit is designed with a
push-pull amplifier setup to handle both half cycles of an AC signal.
It includes two matching transistors, one being an NPN-type and the
other a PNP-type. Both power transistors receive the same input
signals equal in magnitude but opposite in phase. This results in one
transistor only amplifying the positive half of the input waveform
cycle while the other amplifies the negative half. The resulting two
halves combine at the output terminal. An error amplifier is also
included to compensate for the input signal fluctuations when we deal
with low-frequency signals. This error amplifier always tries to make
the input and output the same. Identical circuits are required for
each sine wave signal. Signals are applied onto the solution through
copper electrodes as shown in Figure \ref{fig:ex6}.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{CPEF - Copy.jpg}
    \caption{Depicts the voltage and current amplifier circuit for a
      pair of AC voltage signal applications in the BZ reaction.}
    \label{fig:ex6}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Front Panel}
The front panel is divided into part I and part II. Part I is
programmed to capture the images with no applied voltage.  Part II is
programmed to capture the images and generate two AC voltage signals
(sine wave or cosine wave). Both parts are the same, as explained
earlier, except for voltage signal generation. Physical channels on
the front panel describe the analog output channels (AO 0 and AO 1) of
the DAQ, which generate two AC voltage signals. Sampling info displays
the sampling frequency (Fs) and the number of samples (\#) of the
voltage signals. Control knobs on the front panel are used to set the
amplitude of the signals. The frequency and phase of the signals can
be varied by using the corresponding numeric control buttons. The
waveform chart displays the generated voltage signals at the output.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth,height=0.6\linewidth]{polarised - Copy.png}
    \caption{The front panel of the LabVIEW program for the image
      acquisition and a pair of AC voltage generation. Part I of the
      front panel is for image acquisition before the AC voltage
      generation and part II is for image acquisition after the AC
      voltage generation}
    \label{fig:ex7}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Block Diagram}
Figure \ref{fig:ex8} and Figure \ref{fig:ex9} show the block diagram
for image acquisition and two AC voltage generation. The block diagram
is divided into two blocks. Block I correspond to part I, and block II
corresponds to part II of the front panel. Each block is included in a
sequence structure that helps to execute the blocks sequentially. The
code in Block I is the same as explained earlier. Block II executes as
soon as we press the Boolean switch on the front panel. When the
‘switch’ is ON, the case selector terminal of both ‘case structures’
on the block diagram changes to TRUE and corresponding codes execute
simultaneously. Code in ‘case structure I’ is for two AC voltage
signal generation and code in ‘case structure II’ is for image
acquisition. The image acquisition code on ‘case structure II’ is the
same as in block I, but images will be stored in a different
folder. The ‘DAQmx Create Virtual Channel (VI)’ creates two different
output ports (AO 0 \& AO 1) of DAQ Device 6343 to generate two voltage
signals with user-defined features. The ‘DAQmx timing VI’ Sets the
source of the sample clock, the rate of the Sample Clock, and the
number of samples to generate. The ‘Sine waveform VIs’ creates two
sine waves with user-specified amplitude, frequency, phase, and
sampling info. The sampling info from the ‘sine waveform VI’ is
directly fed to ‘DAQmx timing VI'. The waveforms are connected to
‘DAQmx Write VI’ to write them.  This connection commands the DAQ
Device to generate signals with the above-mentioned
features. Generated signal can be visually observed in the waveform
chart displayed on the front panel. The ‘DAQmx Start Task VI’ starts
the signal generation task, and ‘DAQmx is task done VI’ on the while
loop checks whether the signal generation task is completed in each
iteration. The ‘DAQmx Clear Task VI’ clears the task to reduce memory
after each iteration. The 'while loops' on the block diagram ensure
the continuous execution of the code. The ‘Error handler’ displays
error messages on the front panel, if any. This code is used to
achieve different polarised electric fields (linearly polarised,
circularly polarised, and elliptically polarised) if we apply these
signals to the chemical solution in four electrode combinations by
changing the phase of the signals by keeping the same amplitude and
frequency.

\section{Conclusions} 
The BZ reaction is a model system for studying chemical and
biological oscillations and provides a platform for exploring the
underlying principles of self-organization and pattern
formation. Spiral and scroll wave unpinning is widely studied in BZ
reaction because of the similarity of the wave dynamics with
biological excitable systems.  The studies in BZ reactions are carried
out using image processing. But due to various factors, imaging the BZ
reaction is challenging. Since the reaction is a non-equilibrium
process and its dynamics change over time, specialized imaging
techniques are required to capture the fast changes and non-stationary
behavior. So, the camera is triggered with counter-output pulses, and
the frequency of the counter signal is used to set the frame rate of
the camera. Additionally, the patterns produced by the BZ reaction can
be difficult to detect since they occur in a semi-transparent
solution. To address this issue, a diffused white LED light source is
placed below the reaction medium, and a blue dichroic filter is
mounted on the camera to enhance imaging. Since the patterns can be
small and occur in three-dimensional space, high spatial-resolution
imaging techniques are required. A CCD camera with a maximum
resolution of 640x480 is used. The user can adjust the required
resolution by changing the image format control option available in NI
Measurements and automation explorer (NI MAX). Furthermore, the BZ
reaction is sensitive to temperature changes, and precise temperature
control is necessary to ensure consistent behavior. Hence, experiments
are performed in an AC room with a controlled ambient temperature.
Unpinning studies use the application of low-voltage electric
fields. Researchers continue to explore new ways to study the BZ
reaction and its excitation wave dynamics using both DC and different
polarised fields. These studies require to control of multiple
instruments simultaneously. Virtual instrumentation allows for
creating of highly accurate, customizable, and easily accessible
instruments that can be used for a wide range of applications. So, we
created two LabVIEW programs to generate DC and AC voltage signals for
the unpinning studies in the BZ reaction. Our programs provide a
user-friendly interface to generate the voltage signals, trigger the
camera, and save the captured images to a computer
simultaneously. With these scripts, we successfully collected the
data, which helped explain the unpinning mechanism in the BZ reaction
in the presence of the DC field and CPEF. One can also modify these
codes and use them to reconstruct scroll waves in the BZ reaction.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
we hope our LabVIEW scripts will be useful for the scientific
community working on BZ reaction or other experiments which involves
image processing and voltage generation by virtual instrumentation.
